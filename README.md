# My Learning Journey

Welcome! Here, this is a personal space where I share my learning progress and thoughts about things. If for some reason you find this repo, I hope you find it useful. :smile:

## Why am I doing this? :thinking:
They say that writing things down helps you remember things better. I'm doing this to help me remember what I've learned and to reflect on my progress. It will organize my thoughts and help me see the bigger picture. I also hope that this will help me become a better writer.

    - It turns out that in (Laravel Eloquent) there is an `increment` and `decrement` methods built in that you can use to increment or decrement a column value by a given amount. For example, if you have a `balance` column in your `users` table, you can do something like this: `$user->increment('balance', 100);` to add 100 to the user's balance. You can also do `$user->decrement('balance', 100);` to subtract 100 from the user's balance. But make sure that you are not using SIGNED INT for the column, otherwise you will have negative values. You can use UNSIGNED INT instead.
