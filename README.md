# My Learning Journey

Welcome! Here, this is a personal space where I share my learning progress and thoughts about things. If for some reason you find this repo, I hope you find it useful. :smile:

## Why am I doing this? :thinking:
They say that writing things down helps you remember things better. I'm doing this to help me remember what I've learned and to reflect on my progress. It will organize my thoughts and help me see the bigger picture. I also hope that this will help me become a better writer.

## Monthly Progress :chart_with_upwards_trend: ( I will update throughout each month, whenever I learn something new )
## Fomat will be as follows:
### Month/Year (MM/YYYY)

    Topics: (List of topics that I will write about)
    - Learned about this
    - Learned about that
    - Learned about this other thing

### 01/2024
- **01/01/2024**

    Topics: (Laravel)
    - It turns out that in (Laravel Eloquent) there is an `increment` and `decrement` methods built in that you can use to increment or decrement a column value by a given amount. For example, if you have a `balance` column in your `users` table, you can do something like this: `$user->increment('balance', 100);` to add 100 to the user's balance. You can also do `$user->decrement('balance', 100);` to subtract 100 from the user's balance. But make sure that you are not using SIGNED INT for the column, otherwise you will have negative values. You can use UNSIGNED INT instead.

    Topics: (Twitter/X)
    - I like Twitter/X, its my favorite social media platform. I like to use it follow people I am interested in and inspire me. Twitter/X has a `For You` tab which is an alothorithmically generated feed of tweets that it thinks you will like. I like this feature because it helps me discover new people and things that I am interested in. But, recently I have noticed Its been showing me things that I am not interested in whatsoever. When you go to `https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests` you can see what are the topcis Twitter/X thinks you are interested in. I counted them using javascript in the console and I have `377` topics apparently. And belive me when I see that 80% of them are not things I am interested in (Example: Mark Zuckerberg, Vladimir Putin, Pumpkin recipes :jack_o_lantern:, etc). So, I deleted them by executing javascript in the browser's console that will uncheck all the checkboxes. Hope this helps me get better recommendations. :smile: <br>
    ***NOTE: when trying to copy a code snippet and paste it in browser's (Chrome) console, you will need to allow pasting in the console by writing `allow pasting` in the console and pressing enter. Then you can paste the code snippet and press enter to execute it.***
