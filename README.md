# My Learning Journey

Welcome!, this is a personal space where I share my learning progress and thoughts about things. If for some reason you find this repo, I hope you find it useful. :smile:

To make things neater and more organized for myself, I will be making it in sync with my dev blog on [dev.to](https://dev.to/). Can be found [here](https://dev.to/irakan) for better categorization and easier navigation.

## Why am I doing this? :thinking:
They say that writing things down helps you remember things better. I'm doing this to help me remember what I've learned and to reflect on my progress. It will organize my thoughts and help me see the bigger picture. I also hope that this will help me become a better writer.

    Topics: (Laravel)
    - It turns out that in (Laravel Eloquent) there is an `increment` and `decrement` methods built in that you can use to increment or decrement a column value by a given amount.<br><br>For example, if you have a `balance` column in your `users` table, you can do something like this: `$user->increment('balance', 100);` to add 100 to the user's balance. You can also do `$user->decrement('balance', 100);` to subtract 100 from the user's balance.<br><br> But make sure that you are not using SIGNED INT for the column, otherwise you will have negative values. You can use UNSIGNED INT instead.

    Topics: (Twitter/X)
    - I like Twitter/X, its my favorite social media platform. I like to use it follow people I am interested in and inspire me. <br><br>Twitter/X has a `For You` tab which is an alothorithmically generated feed of tweets that it thinks you will like. I like this feature because it helps me discover new people and things that I am interested in.<br><br> But, recently I have noticed Its been showing me things that I am not interested in whatsoever. When you go to `https://twitter.com/settings/your_twitter_data/twitter_interests` you can see what are the topcis Twitter/X thinks you are interested in. <br><br>So, I counted them using javascript in the console and I have `377` topics apparently. And belive me when I see that 80% of them are not things I am interested in (Example: Mark Zuckerberg, Vladimir Putin, Pumpkin recipes :jack_o_lantern:, etc). So, I deleted them by executing javascript in the browser's console that will uncheck all the checkboxes. Hope this helps me get better recommendations. :smile: <br><br>
    ***NOTE: when trying to copy a code snippet and paste it in browser's (Chrome) console, you will need to allow pasting in the console by writing `allow pasting` in the console and pressing enter. Then you can paste the code snippet and press enter to execute it.***

    Topics: (Meetings)
    - Today while driving, I was listening to a podcast between David Heinemeier Hansson and Jason Fried (Basecamp founders). They were talking about how toxic meetings are for various reasons:
        - 1 hour meeting with 5 people is not a 1 hour meeting, its a 5 hour meeting. Because you are taking 1 hour of each person's time. So, you need to be very careful when you call a meeting.
        - They involve coordination, causing scheduling issues and disrupting everyone's workflow and mindset
        - They are usually not productive, because people are rarely prepared for them.
        - They drift off topic and go on tangents that are not relevant to the meeting.

        After I finished listing to the podcast, I wanted to check if there are facts that support this. I found this reserch on [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2017/07/stop-the-meeting-madness) According to their survey of 182 senior managers across industries:
        - 65% said meetings hindered their personal work completion.
        - 71% found meetings unproductive and inefficient.
        - 64% felt meetings compromised deep thinking.
        - 62% believed meetings missed opportunities to bring the team closer.

        So, here is what some companies (Example: Basecamp and 37signals) do to avoid traditional meetings:
        - They go to first-writing approach instead of a first-meeeting approach. If there's something to discuss, write it down first, share it with the team, and then have a meeting only if and only if it's absolutely necessary.
        - They use automatic weekly check-ins, like "What did you do this week?" through platforms like Slack. This keeps everyone informed and enables the creation of weekly reports for the team and stakeholders.
        - There are also occasional automated "social questions" to encourage team members to share non-work-related activities, fostering better relationships.

        As a result, the stakeholders are happy because they are getting weekly reports and the team is happy because they are not wasting their time in meetings. :smile:

    Topics: (Mentalhealth, Motivation)
    - Today I came across multiple posts talking about "Toxic Positivity", and the first question that came to my mind is "How can positivity be toxic!?" 😅. Here is the explanation of what does "Toxic Positivity" means:

        > Toxic positivity is the belief that one should always maintain a positive mindset, no matter the circumstances. It discourages acknowledging or expressing negative emotions.
        
        I did some research about this and actually, the words in (Toxic positivity) are oxymoron, which means logically there is no such thing as "Toxic positivity". It's like saying "Square Circle" or "Married Bachelor" which doesn't make any sense.
        
        So, for now, let's call it "Fake positivity" or "Empty positivity". Which I truly believe it exists, where people throw around phrases like:
        - Good vibes only. ✌️😁
        - Stop being so negative, Think happy thoughts only. 🛑😃
        - Just be positive. 😊
        - Stay positive, everything will be fine.😃
        
        to someone going through a tough time or feeling stuck. These words feel empty and It's like a quick-fix without really understanding the depth of what the person is going through.
        
        I came across this example that will clarify things better:
        
        > Would you tell a crying baby to just cheer up and think positive?
        > No. You would realize the baby is crying because they are cold, hungry, wet, or want to be held. You would fix what was wrong instead of trying to silence them.
        
        It's good to have emotions and feel them.. just don't stay there forever. And If you surround yourself with an environment that solely emphasizes positive vibes, it can be harmful because it promotes an unrealistic approach to life.
        
        > We should grieve, be angry, feel rejected when appropriate. However, the key is not to stay in the emotion.

    Topics: (kubernetes)
    - I recently found myself lacking knowledge about Kubernetes. I have read some posts about it, and I know it's like a management tool. It's somewhat similar to Composer and NPM for managing packages, but Kubernetes is for managing Docker containers. I didn't dive into it in the past because it was not relevant to me, and to be completely honest, I was running away from it (maybe scared). Now it's time to face it. 😬

        As they say, knowing the name of the enemy is the first step towards winning! Today, I want to shed light on its name. Kubernetes!? For some reason, I didn't like it. It's a long word, and I always find myself struggling to pronounce it. 🤔
        
        After researching, I found that Craig McLuckie, one of the founders of the Google-based Kubernetes project, said:
        
        > We had 13 other names we couldn’t get past Google’s legal department. It was the last day, and I had to pick something. I was driving into work, and I thought, ‘Well, [the technology] is like driving a container ship. What would the helmsman be called?’ So I tried to find something exotic. I had no idea what the Greek for that was. I had to look it up.
        
        Basically, the word "κυβερνήτης" ([Check How to pronounce κυβερνήτης](https://en.bab.la/pronunciation/greek/%CE%BA%CF%85%CE%B2%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BD%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82)) is a Greek term that translates to "helmsman" or "steersman" in English.
        
        To make sure, I opened Google Translator and typed "helmsman" then translated it into Greek, which gave me "πηδαλιούχος" pronounced as "pidalioúchos." That's incorrect; it's not even close to Kubernetes's word sound. I dug deeper and found the Liddell & Scott Greek-to-English lexicon, published in 1909, which had these meanings: "steersman, helmsman, guide, governor" for "κυβερνήτης." on page 397, which I was looking for. 
        
        Now, what does "helmsman" mean?
        
        > A helmsman or helm (sometimes driver or steersman) is a person who steers a ship, sailboat, submarine, or any other type of maritime vessel or spacecraft. 
        
        Another question: Why do people mention it sometimes as K8s?
        
        "K8s" is shorthand for Kubernetes because there are 8 letters between "K" and "s" in the word "Kubernetes" making it shorter and easier to type without spelling mistakes. 
        
        Now that I know the origin of "Kubernetes" I can sleep in peace. 😴

    Topics: (Hypervisor)
    - Imagine you have a powerful computer, and you want to run multiple operating systems (like Windows, Linux, or others) on the same machine, all at the same time. 

        This is where a hypervisor comes in. Hypervisor is like a traffic cop for your computer. Its main job is to manage and control different operating systems that want to use the same hardware (like your computer's processor, memory, and storage).
        
        The hypervisor treats resources—like CPU, memory, and storage—as a pool that can be easily reallocated between existing guests or to new virtual machines.

        There are two types of hypervisors:
        - Type 1: Bare Metal Hypervisor
            - What? 
                - A bare-metal (or native) hypervisor is a layer of software that runs directly on the host's hardware and manages the guest operating systems that run on top of it.
            - Who?
                - It's used by large enterprises and data centers(like Amazon, Google, Facebook, etc) to run multiple operating systems on the same machine.
            - Example:
                - VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix Hypervisor, and Oracle VM Server for x86.
            - When to Use:
                - Enterprise Servers: If you're managing a large data center or server farm, Type 1 hypervisors are often preferred for their efficiency and performance.
                - Resource Optimization: When you need the maximum possible performance and want the hypervisor to have direct access to the hardware resources.
        - Type 2: Hosted Hypervisor
            - What?
                - A hosted hypervisor is a hypervisor that runs on top of an operating system (like Windows, Linux, or macOS) and shares the host's hardware resources with the guest operating systems.
            - Who?
                - It's used by developers and individuals to run multiple operating systems on the same machine.
            - When to Use:
                - Ease of Use: When you want a simpler setup and don't require the highest level of performance.
                - Software Development: For developers who need to test their applications on multiple platforms without using separate physical machines.
            - Example:
                - VMware Workstation, VMware Fusion, Oracle VM VirtualBox, and Parallels Desktop for Mac.
